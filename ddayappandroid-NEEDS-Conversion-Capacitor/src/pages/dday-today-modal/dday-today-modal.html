      Rarely has history so greatly been impacted in a single 24-hour period as on D-Day. The Allied success in Normandy not only set in
      motion the destruction of the Nazi regime, but also positioned the forces of democracy for the struggle that would mark the second 
      half of the 20th century: the Cold War. Since then, D-Day has come to be understood as a watershed event, the first step in a long 
      campaign to replace fascism with freedom, oppression with opportunity, and injustice with equality. It is a struggle that continues 
      to this day; we all live with the legacy of D-Day.
