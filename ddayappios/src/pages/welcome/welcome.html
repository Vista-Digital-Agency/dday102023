          Established as the town of Liberty in 1782, Bedford quickly became well known as the county seat and as a center for the production and distribution of tabacco, 
          corn, wool, textiles and eventually synthetic rubber products. The community of Beford is located at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains with the picturesque Peaks 
          of Otter as a backdrop.

          Many of Bedford's structures were built in the 1880s and 1890s, replacing the wooden buildings lost in a fire in 1884. The primary architecture reflects the Victorian era's 
          Italianate style with ornate window details and a wide variety of arches and decorative cornices. In contrast to the elaborate Victorian buildings, Bedford also boasts a number of 
          classical Revival buildings, elegant in the simplicity of their design.

          It is in this setting that the famed "Bedford Boys" would spend their youth. Most joined up with the Virginia National Guard - Company A of the 116th Infantry Regiment of the 29th 
          Division. The primary incentive for many was the extra dollar per day and the handsome new uniforms that many of the men felt would attract the ladies. Few of them believed 
          they would be mobilized for war and embroiled in the largest invasion in history.

          Among the hundreds of thousands massed off the shores of Normandy on the morning of 6 June 1944 were 44 soldiers, sailors, and airmen from the town and county of Bedford, Virginia. 
          Thirty-seven of these young men belonged to Company A of the 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Division. Three others were assigned to other companies of the 116th, another one to a 
          different division, and one served with the Navy in support of the landings. Two more sons of Bedford were in the skies that morning as part of the pre-invasion bombardment. For 
          almost all of them, this would be their baptism by fire.
        </p>

        <p>
          The invasion plan called for Company A to land at Dog Green sector of Omaha Beach at 0630 as part of the first wave. Unfortunately, heavy cloud cover that morning made distinguishing targets difficult. 
          Fearful of accidentally dropping ordnance on Allied landing craft waiting offshore, many planes and ships directed their fire further inland, leaving German beach fortifications in some places 
          almost untouched - with catastrophic consequences. When Company A landed on target and on time at Dog Green beach - one of only a handful of units to do so - they received the fire 
          intended for a much larger force.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Bedford, the result was especially devastating. Of 37 assigned to Company A, 31 loaded into landing craft and headed to Omaha Beach in the first wave; the remainder belonged to supply details and 
          would arrive later. En route, a landing craft struck an obstacle and sank, stranding dozens far from shore, including five of Bedford's boys. The remaining 26 successfully reached Omaha Beach, where 
          16 were killed and 4 wounded in a matter of minutes. Three others were unaccounted for and later presumed killed in action. Another Bedford boy was killed in action elsewhere on Omaha Beach with Company 
          F, bringing Bedford's D-Day fatalities to a total number of 20. In comparison with its 1940s population, Bedford suffered the nation's severest per capita D-Day loss, a somber distinction for this rural 
          Virginia community. For that reason, Congress designated Bedford as the site for the National D-Day Memorial.
        </p>

        <p>
          Illustrating the depths of Bedford's loss in the story of Mrs. John Hoback, a woman of grit and character. In July 1944, she recieved telegrams notifying her that both of her sons had been lost on 
          D-Day. She carried on, but she did so with a large piece of herself missing. Many years later when she was on the brink of death and lay in her bed (tired and incoherent after a series of strokes), 
          she asked over and over again, "Where are my boys?" When death closed her eyes for the last time, she finally found them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The war changed the men who fought it and it changed the ones left behind to mourn. The war also transformed communities like Bedford who sent their young sons and daughters off to war. 
          Many of them never returned. Bedford is emblematic of all those homefront communities who served and sacrificed so we could be free.
