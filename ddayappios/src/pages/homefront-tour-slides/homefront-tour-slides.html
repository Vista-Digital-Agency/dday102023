        1) Bedford's Factories: Smyth
      </ion-card-header>

      <ion-card-content>
        <p>
          Like most throughout the nation, Bedford’s factories converted to wartime production during WWII. This factory, 
          formerly Piedmont Label, opened in 1919 and is Bedford’s oldest factory in continuous operation. Rubatex began making 
          insulation for aircraft and submarines and hoses for gas masks. Hampton Looms produced woolen uniforms while Belding 
          Hemingway made rayon thread for parachutes. Southern Flavoring Company also made parachute parts and the Bedford Pulp 
          and Paper Company contributed to the war effort making cardboard boxes and pallets for shipping, as well as powder for firing guns.

        2) Fishers Restaurant
      </ion-card-header>

      <ion-card-content>
        <p>
            This traditional 1940’s diner serviced the community and the nearby train station. Its history dates to the 1930s as a 
            one-room hotdog stand. By the time WWII started, the current building was in place and the locals would congregate 
            here before and after shifts at nearby factories, while travelers from the passenger depot would take the two-minute walk 
            to grab a bite between trains. The Bedford Boys would have certainly known this familiar haunt and carried fond memories of it into the war.

            As in other small towns, Bedford’s railroad station was the hub of community life. Transportation of passengers, freight, and mail, from 
            the railways’ inception through WWII, meant that such railroad stations were a vital part of both the local and national economy. 
            Built in 1881, the station remained in service until 1971. WWII found the station participating in the transportation of troops, supplies and ammunition.

            The Bedford Boys left for service from this very station in February 1941, while the nation was still at peace. Little could they know the role in history they would play.

            On February 17, 1941 the Bedford Boys attended a dance and farewell party where many of them had attended high school. For many, 
            it would be the last time they would walk through its halls. The class of 1944 erected a plaque outside of the school to those who attended the high school and were killed in World War II.

            Visitors may continue on to Oakwood and Greenwood Cemeteries where 9 of the 20 Bedford Boys who died on D-Day are at rest.

      <ion-card-content>
        <p>
            Known as Green’s Drug Store during WWII, this corner was a gathering place for locals. Tucked away in the back of the drug store behind a wooden booth was a small 
            Western Union telegraph office. Twenty-one-year-old Elizabeth Teass was manning the teletype machine on July 17, 1944 when she was stunned to receive a series of 
            telegrams with the words “The Secretary of War desires me to express his deep regret....” The teletype machine continued with one message after another. The community of Bedford would be forever changed.

            In February 1941, Co. A of the 116th Infantry Regiment, Virginia National Guard, kissed mothers and girlfriends goodbye and filed onto a waiting train at 
            Bedford’s depot. By the end of the year, America was at war, and the Bedford Boys were in it for the duration. Nineteen men from Co. A, and another Bedford 
            Boy from Co. F, perished on the beaches of Normandy. The loss of 20 young men was the highest per capita loss of any community in the United States.

        <p>
            In 1954, ten years after the Normandy Invasion, the Bedford community came together to dedicate a monument to its lost sons. The stone, located outside of Bedford’s Courthouse, reads, “Erected by the Parker-Hoback Post, 29th Division Association, in memory of the Bedford County men of the 
            116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Division, who gave their lives in preparation for and the participation in the Normandy Invasion and later battles of World War II.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The stone on which the monument appears was secured from Vierville-Sur-Mer on Normandy Beach and was a gift of the Republic of France.
